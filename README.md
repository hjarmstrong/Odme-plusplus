Odme++
===========

Odme++ is a lightweight c++ IRC library for windows.

Eventually I plan to move away form winsockets, and to provide
a GNU Make build process.

Odme CLI

===========

Odme CLI is a cross platform IRC bot which depends on Odme++.
The bot implements a voting system in a given chartroom.

Currently Odme only takes commands and count votes from any user,
due to limitations from the Odme++ library. Eventually usernames
will only be able to make 1 vote, and only and only admins will
be able to send commands.
